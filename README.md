Package license: Apache

Summary: GC2D is a two-dimensional finite difference numerical model that
is driven by a calculations of glacier mass balance (snow precipitation
- melt rate). The model calculates ice surface elevations above a
two-dimensional terrain by solving equations for ice flux and mass
conservation using explicit methods.
